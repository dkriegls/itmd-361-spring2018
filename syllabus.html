          <h3>Course Catalog Description</h3>
          <p>
            This course will cover the creation of Web pages and sites using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and graphical applications as well as the client and server architecture of the Internet and related web technologies. The creation and deployment of modern,
            standards-compliant web pages are addressed. Students create and deploy a Web site with multiple pages and cross-linked structures.
          </p>
          <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
          <p>
            Students completing this course will learn to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recognize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript markup and code.</li>
            <li>Select the proper mark-up tags or code to achieve a particular result.</li>
            <li>Identify improperly used markup and code.</li>
            <li>Produce modern standards compliant web pages.</li>
            <li>Deploy web pages to a GitHub server.</li>
            <li>
              Write valid, well-formed semantic HTML; error-free, backward- and forward-compatible CSS; and error-free, progressively enhanced JavaScript over HTML pages that continue to function in the absence of JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>Effectively comment on and format source code for maximum readability.</li>
            <li>Track the development of a project over time and collaborate with others using version control.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Course Objectives</h3>

            </li>
            <li>
              Research and argue for particular methods of web development that keep structure in HTML, design entirely in CSS, and progressively enhanced behavior in JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engage in agile, iterative web development, supported by version control.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write useful, descriptive messages attached to granular commits in a version control.

          <h3>Course Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The course emphasizes standards and research. You will learn to make websites that last and are accessibe to everyone. The course avoids quick-fix shortcuts that too often plague web development practice and online instruction. Student work is organized
            around several major projects. All projects emphasize the course’s hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web development.

            Readings for the class will be assigned from the textbooks as well as in the form of on-line readings. On-line resources and videos will be linked from or embedded in a Blackboard page. It is essential that you do all readings before coming to class on
            the assigned date. These materials are a necessary and integral part of the class and will form the basis for any class discussions on the topic. Specific readings are assigned by topic on the calender.

          <h3>Assignments</h3>
          <p>
            All major projects for this course will be submitted via Basecamp. Submissions should <b>not</b> include attachments, but rather URLs pointing to your project’s GitHub repository and live link. Examples will be demonstrated in class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>All work submissions must pass HTML and CSS validation</b> with the
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS validator</a>. Any work whose HTML does not validate will receive a 50&#x25;-point reduction, failing grade. Get in the habit
            early of validating each time before you commit your work to GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each project description.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will check to see that you are adding proper summaries of your GitHub commits. You are also expected to help other students on Basecamp. This means polite give-and-take discussions of code. Do not discuss anything else on basecamp. Practice professional
            and supportive critiquing.

          <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
          <p>
            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a> as described in the
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text,
            as well as any use of open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage, dissemination, and other use of data from third-party
            sources must conform to the source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student
            who violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including
            reporting violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.

            I place a very high value on developing courses that are welcoming and accessible to all students. I will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter
            of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The <a href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2 (on the first floor). Contact the Center

          </p>
          <p>
            Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or electronically, at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods,
            materials, or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all students.
