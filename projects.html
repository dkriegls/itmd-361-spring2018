            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>First Deliverable:</strong> Create a Basecamp post describing your work in progress. Title the post with your name and project number (example Daniel Krieglstein: Project 1). Your post should include:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The URL to your GitHub repository, and the URL to your Github Pages live link
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Two questions eliciting feedback on from fellow students
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Second Deliverable:</strong> Give constructive comments to help at least three other students.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Third Deliverable:</strong> Edit your original Basecamp post under Project 1 by fixing your code based on feedback from the professor and fellow students. Additionally, add the following:
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add a 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
          </section>
          <section class="requirements">
            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style in your content page
              </li>
              <li>
                Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indtned 2 space right of its parent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Valid, well-formed semantic HTML5. Projects whose HTML does not validate with the
                <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> will receive a -50% point loss.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Absolutely no</b> br tags, use of tables for layout, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout. (All layout and design will be handled via CSS in the next project. For this project, I urge you not to spend much time
                at all looking at your pages in a browser. Stick close to your source code and the HTML validator.)
              </li>
              <li>
                A navigation area for accessing each of your project’s pages from any other page
              </li>
              <li>
                Include at least two different forms of media (image, audio, video) in your project
              </li>
              <li>
                No code-generators like WYSIWYGs, Bootstrap, or other off-the-shelf frameworks
              </li>
              <li>
                Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. "https://dkriegls.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.css"
              </li>
              <li>
                A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make
              </li>
              <li>
                Git repository must contain <b>only</b> the files and commits from this project. Each website you make for this class should have its own repository.

                Fork your Project One directory in Github to create a project two directory. Create a new Basecamp post under "Project Two" with a link to your new directory. Add three of the same style elements to each of your pages. Also add three different style elements
                to each of your pages. Include in the text of your basecamp post one or two <b>specific</b> things you would like feedback or help on from the instructor and other students in the class.
