              <strong>First Deliverable:</strong> Create a Basecamp post describing your work in progress. 
              Title the post with your name and project number (example Daniel Krieglstein: Project 1). Your post should
              include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The URL to your GitHub repository, and the URL to your Github Pages live link
                </li>
                <li>
                  Two questions eliciting feedback on from fellow students

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Second Deliverable:</strong> Give constructive comments to help at least three other students.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Third Deliverable:</strong> Edit your original Basecamp post under Project 1 by fixing your code
               based on feedback from the professor and fellow students. Additionally, add the following:
            </li> 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add a 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this

        <section class="requirements">
          <h4>Requirements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style in your content page
            </li>					
            <li>
              Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indtned 2 space right of its parent. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Valid, well-formed semantic HTML5. Projects whose HTML does not validate with the
              <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> will receive a -50% point loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Absolutely no</b> br tags, use of tables for layout, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout.
              (All layout and design will be handled via CSS in the next project. For this project, I
              urge you not to spend much time at all looking at your pages in a browser. Stick close
              to your source code and the HTML validator.)
            </li>
            <li>
              A navigation area for accessing each of your project’s pages

            </li>
            <li>
              Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your 
              own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. "https://dkriegls.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.css"
            </li>
            <li>
              A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately
              reflect each set of changes that you make
            </li>
            <li>
              Git repository must contain <b>only</b> the files and commits from this project. Each 
              website you make for this class should have its own repository.
